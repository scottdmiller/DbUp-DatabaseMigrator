Writing Center tutors are those good readers! During face-to-face tutorials for individuals or small groups, writers hear how real world readers will react to their drafts. Whether you are just starting a paper and want to brainstorm or narrow your topic, or well into the draft and in need of feedback about such topics as organization, syntax, and logical flow of ideas, tutors will provide you with the feedback and instruction you desire. 

By the end of your tutorial, you will know where the meaning is breaking down and why. You wll also have specific strategies for revising and improving the quality of your writing. A follow-up tutorial is always recommended to ensure that you have learned what you wanted and needed to learn. <br><br>
<p>
Prior to your tutorial, be sure to formulate a few specific questions for your tutor. That way, you and your tutor can focus on those concerns as soon as your tutorial begins. From time to time, however, your tutor may find it necessary to talk with you about topics that you didn''t realize needed discussing. For example, if you came in with the goal of working on comma rules, but your tutor notices that many sentences are poorly organized or not on topic, he or she may draw your attention to those problems and then invite you back for a subsequent tutorial where a conversation about comma rules will be more appropriate and helpful. <br><br>

We also understand that writing becomes even more challenging when writing about subjects that are new to us. In those instances, we can help writers increase their understanding of a subject by asking probing questions that challenge assumptions or require a deeper, more thorough examination of the topic.

In 1982, Dr. Jeanette Harris established a writing center in the
English Department at Texas Tech University.  The mission of the writing center at that
time was to serve students taking freshman composition courses,
although all writers were welcome.  Over the years, statistics
showed that approximately 50% (plus or minus)  of the clients
each year were first year students, but the other 50% (plus or
minus) were sophomores, juniors, and seniors as well as some
graduate students and a few faculty members.</p>
<p style=''margin-top:15px''>
Because the writing center staff was serving students from across
the disciplines, in 1995, the English Department writing center
became the University Writing Center. To increase its accessibility to
Tech students, the University Writing Center expanded its
services to include the University Writing Center OWL (online
writing center) in January 1996. Then, in September 1997, the
University Writing Center established a satellite in the Advanced
Technology Learning Center, located in the basement of the Texas
Tech University Library. The satellite center was closed in the Spring of 2001. 
</p>
<p>
<p style=''margin-top:15px''>
Today, the mission of the University Writing Center is to assist
writers, regardless of their status (faculty or students,
undergraduate or graduate), their level of proficiency, or their
college, during the various stages of their writing project; to
create a supportive environment in which writers and their
readers can work effectively one-to-one, both face-to-face as
well as onscreen and online; and to train writing consultants to
become knowledgeable, effective readers of and responders to
texts from various disciplines.

</p><p>
<b>Question: Can I require my students to come to the UWC?</b>
</p><p>
Answer: While we certainly want faculty recommending our services, the UWC asks that faculty not issue a blanket requirement that all students in a given course be tutored for a specific assignment. Doing so can breed resentment to the tutoring process; moreover, due to the ever-increasing demand for our services, we can no longer ensure that appointments will be available in the timeframe a particular course needs.
</p><p>
<b>Question: How does the UWC go about notifying faculty of a student''s tutorial?</b>

Answer: Assuming the student has given us permission to do so, we will send you an email notification. Notifications go out once a week, usually on Monday or Friday.
</p><p>
<b>Question: Does the UWC tutor group projects?</b>

Answer: Yes, we do onsite. However, we now require that all students who are participating in a group project attend any scheduled tutorials. That way, we can ensure that all writers are receiving the instruction feedback necessary for a successful project.

Texas Tech University graduate students and postdoctoral researchers may use the Graduate Student Writing Center. Other members of the Texas Tech University community are invited to use the   <a href="http://uwc.ttu.edu/">University Writing Center</a>.

<h3>Where is the Grad Student Writing Center located?</h3> 
The Graduate Student Writing Center is located in room 43 of the Administration Building, which is in the <a href="http://www.gsac.ttu.edu/directions-to-the-graduate-center/">Graduate Center</a>. Only graduate students and postdoctoral researchers are authorized to be in the Graduate Center; they must swipe their University IDs to enter.
  
<h3>When is the Grad Student Writing Center open?</h3> 
The Graduate Student Writing Center is open Monday through Thursday from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM and Friday 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM when classes are in session. 

<h3>What should I expect from a consultation?</h3> 

Writing consultations are collaborative. Rather than proofreading or editing, your tutor will ask thoughtful questions and offer suggestions in order to help you consider new perspectives, clarify your arguments, and provide strategies for revision. This discussion-based approach will help you become a more confident, competent writer. 
Before your consultation, prepare a few specific questions or concerns to share with your tutor. Keep in mind, however, that tutors may redirect your discussion to other issues you may not have considered. For example, you may bring in your CV and wish to focus on grammar and syntax, but your tutor may notice that your information could be better organized. You are always encouraged to make follow-up appointments in order to review your revisions with a tutor.</p>


<h3>Which documents does the Grad Student Writing Center tutor?</h3> 
<p>
Graduate students may ask for feedback on any type of writing at any stage of the writing process. The Graduate Writing Center often provides feedback on thesis and dissertation chapters, thesis and dissertation proposals, graduate coursework (e.g. seminar papers, reading responses), articles for publication, conference papers, conference abstracts, CVs and resumes, personal statements, and teaching philosophies.

<h3>Will the Grad Student Writing Center provide advice about the content of my project?</h3> 
<p>
In writing, meaning and form cannot be divorced; the way a document is written affects the way an audience interprets its content. However, please understand that our tutors are not specialists in every discipline and therefore cannot advise you about the content of your project. You must consult with professors and others working in your field to receive feedback on this element of your writing. However, our tutors can help you to consider issues such as unity, coherence, organization, style, citation, grammar, and syntax. </p>
</p>
<h3>Who are your tutors?</h3> 
<p>
The tutors in the Graduate Student Writing Center are graduate students, lecturers, and professionals with Master''s degrees or higher. Most of our tutors are from the field of English, but we also have tutors from other disciplines. This semester, we have tutors from English, psychology, and atmospheric science.
<h3>Does the Grad Student Writing Center provide online tutoring?</h3>
Unfortunately, the Grad Student Writing Center does not provide online tutoring services at this time. Distance students and others interested in online tutoring are invited to use the <a href="http://uwc.ttu.edu/">University Writing Center</a>.

<h3>What are your policies for writing consultations?</h3>
